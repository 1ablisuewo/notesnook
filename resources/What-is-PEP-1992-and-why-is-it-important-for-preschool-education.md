PEP 1992 is the acronym for **Programa de EducaciÃ³n Preescolar**, which means Preschool Education Program in Spanish. It was a curriculum document issued by the Mexican Ministry of Education in 1992, which established the goals, contents and methods of preschool education in Mexico[^1^]. PEP 1992 was based on the principles of constructivism, active learning, social interaction and diversity[^2^]. It aimed to promote the development of children's cognitive, affective, social and physical skills through meaningful and playful activities[^3^].

PEP 1992 was a landmark document that influenced the subsequent reforms and innovations in preschool education in Mexico and other Latin American countries. It was praised for its pedagogical coherence, its respect for children's rights and interests, and its relevance for the social and cultural context of Mexico[^5^]. However, it also faced some challenges and criticisms, such as the lack of adequate training and support for teachers, the difficulty of implementing it in rural and marginalized areas, and the need to update it according to the changing needs and demands of society[^5^]. In 2004, PEP 1992 was replaced by a new curriculum document called PEP 2004, which introduced some changes and adjustments to the previous one[^5^].
 
PEP 1992 was an important milestone in the history of preschool education in Mexico. It reflected the educational vision and values of its time, and contributed to the improvement of the quality and equity of preschool education. It also inspired many educators and researchers to study and evaluate its implementation and impact.
